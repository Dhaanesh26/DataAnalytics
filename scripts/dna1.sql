# Data Standardization - String Functions

# 1. TRIM() - Removes leading or trailing spaces
SELECT TRIM(CustomerName) AS Lefy  FROM customer;

# 2. LTRIM() - Removes spaces from beginning of string
SELECT LTRIM(CustomerName) FROM customer;

# 3. RTRIM() - Removes spaces from the end of string
SELECT RTRIM(CustomerName) FROM customer;

# 4. UPPER AND LOWER - Converts to upper and lower case
SELECT UPPER(CustomerName) AS Capitalized, LOWER(CustomerName) AS Small FROM customer;

# 5. LENGTH() - Finds lenght of string
SELECT LENGTH(CustomerName) AS No_of_characters FROM customer; 

# 6. CHAR_LENGTH - No of characters in byte style
SELECT CHAR_LENGTH(CustomerName) FROM customer;

# 7. SUBSTRING("string", "position to start", "no of characters to extract") - Extract a part of string 
SELECT CustomerName, SUBSTRING(CustomerName, 2, 4) AS Extracted_String FROM customer;

# 8. INSTR() - Finds a position of a character
SELECT INSTR('dhaanesh.suresh@gmail.com', '@');

# 9. CONCAT() - Combines two strings 
SELECT CONCAT("Dhaanesh", "Suresh");

# 10. REPLACE() - Replaces any character with other character
SELECT REPLACE("123-456", "-", "");

# REGEXP_REPLACE() - Removes unwanted patterns
SELECT PhoneNumber, REGEXP_REPLACE(PhoneNumber, '[^0-9]', "") FROM customer;

# Q1. Remove extra spaces & fix casing in names 
SELECT TRIM(UPPER(CustomerName)) AS Standard_Name FROM customer;

# Q5. Get the domain name of the email
SELECT SUBSTRING(Email, INSTR(Email, '@') + 1) AS domain_name FROM customer;

# Removes unwanted character from phone number
SELECT PhoneNumber, REGEXP_REPLACE(PhoneNumber, '[^0-9]', '') AS Clean_PhoneNumber FROM customer;

# Phone Number in standardised format
